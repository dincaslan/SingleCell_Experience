Hi,

Here are three books that I can recommend to beginners like me to learn the basics and important points regarding the single cell assay developemnt:
Although the field has still been evolving (and very fast, sometimes I feel it is almost impossible to catch), I would like to recommend these books as a starter pack to learn the basics:
(considering that you already have basic knowledge of sequencing and common molecular biology techniques)

* Single Cell Biomedicine (2018,Springer)

* Bioconjugate Techniques (2013, 3rd Ed,Pierce Tech)

* Single Cell Methods, Sequencing and Proteomics (2019,Springer)

Besides, the good and updates reviews will also be a very nice step!

Good luck in your studies
