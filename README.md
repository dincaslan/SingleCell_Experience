# SingleCell_Experience

Hi, I am Fatma. I am a newbie PhD student in the field of single cell assay development at NUS.

If you folks are are inexperienced like me in this field, this repository might be helpful for you guys as well. I am here to share my wetlab experience (some part I need to keep it private due to its close relevance to my unpublished PhD work), and codes (especially the ones that already avaialable online, Seurat, but need some modifications to work out in my work. Therefore you can see what you need to change if you experience similar problems.

I am inexperienced in GitHub as well. However, I am willing to learn more in my free times. So, you can fork, commit (whatever the term is), namely add and update with your contribution in the future.

See y'all!
Take care!
