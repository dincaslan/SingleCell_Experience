When dealing with Total RNA, you might need to deal with comprehensive RNA biotype information instead of focusing on a few of them.

If you are looking for how to make use of the data, then you might need to preliminary check out all these biotypes before further processing. 

I will be sharing the ways I have tried with simple modifications or implementations on common and available tutorials (e.g., Seurat-based).

#### Recommendations
* For single-cell total RNA-seq, an alternative approach would be [VASA-Seq](https://github.com/hemberg-lab/VASAseq_2022)
* For bulk total RNA-seq, an alternative would be [MGCount](https://github.com/hitaandrea/MGcount/tree/main)
